 This thing splits whitespace characters, if the first element is empty then it is skipped
 That is why comments have a space before them

 You can check the DynamicLevel to see what it parses, here is a short list
 "Variable" = "Float Value"
 line points "x1" "y1" "x2" "y2"
 line horizontal "x1" "y1" "width"
 line vertical "x1" "y1" "height"
